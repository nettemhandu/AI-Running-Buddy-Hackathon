# Ai-Running-Buddy-Hackathon

The goal was to:

Build a simple app using a free AI API to pull data, display it, and add a fun AI-powered feature.
No experience needed—just curiosity and creativity! ✨


🌟 Features

🌦️ Live Weather Updates – Enter your city and get real-time weather.

💬 Motivational AI Messages – Boosts your energy with fun, AI-powered quotes (debugging).

🎨 Sleek Dark Mode UI – Simple, modern, and mobile-friendly design.


🚀 How It Works

User enters a city name.

The app fetches live weather data via an API.

AI generates a motivational running message based on conditions. (harded coded for now)

Everything is displayed in a clean, dark-mode interface.


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (Flask) – Backend

HTML + CSS – Frontend

OpenWeather API – Weather data

Hugging Face API – Motivational AI messages (not fully functional)
