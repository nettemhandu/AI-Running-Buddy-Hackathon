## AI-Running-Buddy-Hackathon

The goal was to:

Build a simple app using a free AI API to pull data, display it, and add a fun AI-powered feature.
No experience needed—just curiosity and creativity.


## Features :

Live Weather Updates – Enter your city and get real-time weather.

Motivational AI Messages – Boosts your energy with fun, AI-powered quotes (debugging).

Sleek Dark Mode UI – Simple, modern, and mobile-friendly design.


## How It Works:

User enters a city name.

The app fetches live weather data via an API.

AI generates a motivational running message based on conditions. (harded coded for now)

Everything is displayed in a clean, dark-mode interface.


## Tech Stack :

Python (Flask) – Backend

HTML + CSS – Frontend

OpenWeather API – Weather data

Hugging Face API – Motivational AI messages (not fully functional)
